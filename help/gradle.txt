Gralde for Ant users
====================

This shows some common ant targets and their equivalent Gradle commands.

Examples below assume cwd is at the top of the checkout (gradlew 
script available from ./).

Quoted [string] gives a better, more conventional and commonly used 
task alternative.


ant clean           => gradlew clean
ant jar             => gradlew jar             [gradlew assemble]

ant compile         => gradlew classes         [gradlew assemble]
                       gradlew testClasses     [gradlew assemble]

ant validate        => gradlew check
ant test            => gradlew test            [gradlew check]

ant jar-checksums   => TODO
ant clean-jars      => NO REPLACEMENT

ant precommit       => gradlew check -x test

If not otherwise qualified, gradle tasks apply to all modules that contain
a given task name. Use "-p" switch with a directory or a colon-notation to
specify a particular task or module. For example:

gradlew -p lucene/core check
gradlew :lucene:core:check


Solr-specific targets
---------------------

ant create-package  => gradlew -p solr/packaging assemble
