Gralde for Ant users
====================

This shows some common ant targets and their equivalent Gradle commands.
Examples below assume cwd is at the top of the checkout (gradlew
script available from ./). Quoted [string] gives a better or more
conventional and commonly used task alternative.

Gradle tasks apply to all modules that contain a given task name. Use
"-p" switch with a directory or a colon-notation to specify a particular
task or module. For example these two are equivalent:

gradlew -p lucene/core check
gradlew :lucene:core:check

List of common targets
----------------------

ant clean           => gradlew clean
ant jar             => gradlew jar             [gradlew assemble]

ant compile         => gradlew classes         [gradlew assemble]
                       gradlew testClasses     [gradlew assemble]

ant validate        => gradlew check
ant test            => gradlew test            [gradlew check]

ant jar-checksums   => TODO
ant clean-jars      => NO REPLACEMENT

ant precommit       => gradlew check -x test

Solr-specific targets
---------------------

ant create-package  => gradlew -p solr/packaging assemble
  # assembled Solr distribution is at solr/packaging/build/...

ant resolve         => gradlew -p solr resolve
  # this task should *not* be used. It is added for backward
  # compatibility with ant but it mixes sources with output locations
  # and this workflow should be discouraged. Instead repackage:
  # gradlew -p solr/packaging assemble

?                   => gradlew mavenLocal
  # create a build-local maven repository with poms, jars, etc.
  # you can preview what would be published.
